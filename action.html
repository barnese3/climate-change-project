		<h2>Be Greener at the Office</h2>

		<p>Don't abandon your earth-friendly habits once you get to the workplace. If you have a desk job, there are plenty of things you can do to reduce your emissions at the office. Start by powering down your computer and other office equipment when you're not using them.</p>
		<p>
		Consider whether that upcoming business trip is really necessary. Can you accomplish what you need in a video conference? That's a more earth-friendly alternative.
		And even the little things, like walking a little farther to toss that drink can in the recycling bin, can go a long way.
		</p>

		
		<h2>Change How You Get Around</h2>

		<p>If you live in a city, check out your public transportation options -- even if it's just one day a week. And if you live close to your job, why not bike or walk to work? It could even save you money on a costly gym membership.</p>
		<p>	
		No matter where you live, there may be carpooling options. Get on your neighborhood social feed and see if you live near someone who works in the same part of town. That could also save a lot of money in gas.
		When you do drive, make sure you're not spending more than 30 seconds idling and go easy on the gas pedal and brakes. Also, check your tire pressure on a regular basis. That can really improve your gas consumption rate.
		</p>



		<h2>Get Informed</h2>

		<p>The most powerful way the average person can combat climate change is to become informed about it, says J. Marshall Shepherd, former president of the American Meteorological Society and professor at the University of Georgia.</p>

		<p>
		"Obviously, it makes sense for people to be as efficient and green as possible in their thinking on a day-to-day basis," he said. "But where I think the biggest impact that individuals can have is: Becoming climate literate.</p>

		<p>
		If you educate yourself about what's going on with climate change and what can be done about it, you can make more informed choices when it comes time to vote for the people with the power to make big decisions.
		"Where the biggest impacts on our planet will be, will come from large-scale policy changes and solutions that are influenced by who's in office," he said.
		Only read trusted and verified sources of information about climate change, Shepherd said. He recommends the websites climate.gov and Climate Central (of which he is a board member) for essential facts and resources. </p>
		
		
		<p>
		Beyond reading up on the issues, you can still do a small part to influence the big environmental picture. 
		</p>

		

		<h2>Get involved and Educate Others about the Big Picture</h2>
		<p>
		Your green strategies in your daily life can have a small impact, but the whole planet has to be on board for dealing with climate change in order to instigate global effects. Even if everyone in the United States reduced their emissions, other countries that continue to dump carbon dioxide into the air would still contribute to warming temperatures and rising sea levels.
		Spread the word about climate change and educating people. The EPA recommends that students give presentations on climate change and encourage their institutions to increase energy efficiency.</p>



		<p>Find out if your community has a climate action plan. There may be ways you can contribute to local efforts to be greener and adapt to potential changes that a warming world would bring.</p>

		<p>Bottom line: if you arm yourself with correct information, you can make informed choices that could affect your community and the planet at large.</p>

		<h2>Become a Vegetarian, or better yet a VEGAN!</h2>

		<p>The share of greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture is usually pegged at 14.5 percent to 18 percent, but the Worldwatch Institute found lots of oversights in those calculations that, when properly counted, bring the ag contribution all the way up to 51 percent. That, you’ll notice, is more than half. Which means that after we clean up all the transportation, energy, industry and commerce in the world, we’ve done less than half the job. The other half is meat and dairy. Refuse to eat it. If this seems too challenging, consider giving it up one day a week. It will still be the most important action you can take.</p>
